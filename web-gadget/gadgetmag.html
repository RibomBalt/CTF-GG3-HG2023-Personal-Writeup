This can cloud his judgment and cause him to make erroneous conclusions. <br><br>
            
            Time Constraints: The "Gadget Magnifying Glass" requires Inspector Gadget to invest significant time in his investigations. By imposing time limits or creating scenarios with pressing urgency, opponents can force him into rushed decision-making.
